    <pre> "If you're the CEO of a company, and you're dumb enough to leave your log-in info on a Post-It note on your desk,
       while the people that you ripped off are physically in your office, it's not a hack.
        It's barely social engineering. Itâ€™s more like natural selection."-Gilfoyle</pre>
